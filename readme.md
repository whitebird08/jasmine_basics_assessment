#Grading Exercise

**Instructions:** Fork and clone this repository.  Create a file called `grader.js` and write the following functions inside of it.  You must have full test coverage(write a bunch of jasmine tests for each function).  This is an open-book exercise.  Feel free to refer to your notes and the jasmine docs.

###Letter Grader

Write a function `letterGrader` which takes a test score and returns the equivalent letter grade.

* A: 90-100
* B: 80-99
* C: 70-79
* D: 60-69
* F: 0-59

```
letterGrader(98);
//=> 'A'
```
**Bonus:** Add '+' and '-' grades.  So a 98 is actually a A+ and an 80 is a B-


###Average

Write a function 'averageScore` which takes an array of test scores and returns the average score.

```
averageScore([90, 95, 87, 60]);
//=> 83
```

###Median

Write a function `medianScore` which takes an array of test scores and calculates the median score.  The median is the middle value.  


```
medianScore([52,80,80,86,94])
//=> 80
```

###Mode

Write a function `modeScore` which takes an array of test scores and calculates the mode score.  The mode is the value that appears most often.

```
modeScore([82, 92, 75, 91, 92, 89, 95, 100, 86])
//=> 92
```
